Dependencies:
npm i
npm i postgres
npm install react-icons --save
npm install recharts

TODOS:
- Add customers to sales so we can properly update database
- Add employee info to sales
- Add delete functionality for employees
- Implement add employees (jon)
- Implement Search functionality for employees (ethan)
- Tiles need to be refined, selectable and a conditional rendering so when one is selected it shows more info


- Implement conditional rendering depending on employee job title (will need a scrum to determine what we need/don't)

Notes: 
- right now login token wont expire
- When selling and quantity is set at 1, db goes down by 2
